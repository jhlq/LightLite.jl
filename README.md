A qubit is like two connected compasses, the size of the first compass is the probability of the qubit being a 0 and the size of the second compass is the probability of 1. Moving the needle around controls a complex number: if the compass points east the imaginary part is zero and north means the real part is zero.

The two compasses can be represented by a vector in a sphere, for example a clock where the hands can point out. Two complex numbers are encoded with three parameters by only considering the difference between them: if the two compasses are spun at the same speed the hand of the clock wont move.
